# PyHSPF

This version of PyHSPF is not the latest version in [my 2019 EM&S paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2019.104514), which is going to be released as a public repo soon. Currently, however, the codes of PyHSPF-WE (water-electricity nexus) model is stored in my private repo 'PyHSPF-WE'.
